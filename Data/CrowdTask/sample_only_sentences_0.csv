wsj_0132_4|Last year , DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions .
wsj_0132_5|The earnings growth also was fueled by the company 's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders .
wsj_0132_2|The 32% state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter , mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations .
wsj_0132_3|The charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company 's construction division .
wsj_0132_0|N.V. DSM said net income in the third quarter jumped 63% as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program .

wsj_1014_0|Anheuser-Busch Cos .
wsj_1014_1|said it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands , setting the stage for a potentially bruising price war as the maturing industry 's growth continues to slow .
wsj_1014_2|Anheuser , the world 's largest brewer and U.S. market leader , has historically been reluctant to engage in price-cutting as a means of boosting sales volume .
wsj_1014_3|With the passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales , however , the once-sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry .
wsj_1014_4|Over the summer , Anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time .
wsj_1014_5|Some experts now predict Anheuser 's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players .
wsj_1014_6|The St. Louis company said major rivals , Philip Morris Co. 's Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co.

wsj_1014_7|Anheuser said it 's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a market-by-market basis .
wsj_1014_8|Anheuser-Busch announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2% to $238.3 million , or 83 cents a share , from $226.5 million , or 78 cents .

wsj_1014_23|But Smith Barney 's Mr. Doyle , who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $2.95 a share from $3.10 , called the market 's reaction ' justified . '
wsj_1014_22|Mr. Thompson noted that the disappointing earnings , which fell five cents a share short of his own projections , contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public .
wsj_1014_21|Mr. Thompson calls discounting ' a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share , ' and projected that Anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle .

wsj_1013_19|The price of Columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since August , when they traded at about $10 , as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down .
wsj_1013_18|Its shares closed at $5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading , down 37.5 cents .
wsj_1013_13|For its future strategy , Columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments , as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities .
wsj_1013_12|Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years , accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices .
wsj_1013_11|Previously , Columbia did n 't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices , because it held the bonds as long-term investments .
wsj_1013_10|The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation , which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994 .
wsj_1013_17|Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market .

wsj_0736_1|Poughkeepsie also expects to post a one-time charge of $8.3 million , resulting in a net loss for the third quarter .

wsj_0376_8|Some analysts have said Courtaulds ' moves could boost the company 's value by 5% to 10% , because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined .
wsj_0376_9|In addition , Courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities .

wsj_0810_12|If holders avoid tendering to Paribas , he added , they can expect strong dividends again next year .
wsj_0810_11|Mr. Fournier said the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last .
wsj_0810_10|That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50% stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte 's insurance business .

wsj_0745_28|In the end , Sir John -- rather than the government or Jaguar shareholders -- may hold the key that unlocks the golden share .
wsj_0745_21|In wooing British lawmakers , GM has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep Jaguar British-owned and independent .

wsj_0745_27|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher might , however , be receptive to any request by Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan for the restriction 's early removal to let GM amass more than 15% or mount a friendly suitor bid against Ford .

wsj_0584_25|Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices .
wsj_0584_26|To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement , BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share , or $540 million , if , after five years , the trading value of the new cellular company isn 't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer .
wsj_0584_27|' We 're very pleased with the new deal .

wsj_0584_21|Under its revised proposal , Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt .
wsj_0584_22|To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company .
wsj_0584_23|The provision , described as ' back-end ' protection , would require BellSouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay .
wsj_0584_28|We did n 't expect BellSouth to be so responsive , ' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , which holds 500,000 LIN shares .

wsj_0583_15|Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .

wsj_0583_17|While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories , Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia .
wsj_0583_10|If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies were n 't deterrents enough , webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers .
wsj_0583_11|Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell , it has few alternatives remaining , and the grim demeanors of Sansui 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's finest hour .
wsj_0583_12|Sansui was once one of Japan 's premier makers of expensive , high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles .
wsj_0583_13|But in recent years , the market has moved toward less expensive ' mini-component ' sets , miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other .
